# Calcu-basic
## Welcome to Calcu-Basic
Calcu-basic is a C++ application that lets you calculate basic arithmetic operations. You only can use 2 numbers in the arithmetic operations, which at the time, weâ€™re fixing it ðŸ”§. The purpose of our project is to let people modify our calculator and also make different results.
## Prerequisites for using our project
You need to learn C++ basics to understand the code, and we'll explain some of the code. But if you know c++, you probably know how the calculator works.
