## Welcome to Calcu-Basic
Calcu-basic is a C++ application that lets you calculate basic arithmetic operations. The purpose of our project is to let people modify our calculator and also make different results.
## Features
The features of Calcu-Basic is in the following:

* Can do basic arithmetic calculations
* Can add up to 3 entries (numbers) (https://github.com/TheRobotCodingMan/Calcu-basic/issues/1)
* User can add up to 2 arithmetic operators (Example, when you add three numbers into the calculator, you can change the operator between the newly typed number and the second to the last typed number)

## Prerequisites for contributing to our project
You need to learn C++ basics to understand the code, but if you know c++, you probably know how the calculator works and how to improve it.

## How to compile code?
Compiling code in local is hard, but can be done. We recommend that you use an online c++ compiler. The link below has the code already and you can copy it:
